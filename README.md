# Topic Modelling using LDA

Welcome to the Topic Modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide and implementation of topic modeling using LDA, a popular technique in natural language processing and machine learning.

## Introduction

Topic modeling is a statistical modeling technique used to discover abstract topics within a collection of documents. It helps uncover hidden thematic structures and identify common patterns in large textual data sets. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is one of the most widely used algorithms for topic modeling.

LDA assumes that documents are produced from a mixture of topics, where each topic is a distribution over words. The algorithm then infers the latent topics based on the observed words in the documents. By analyzing the distribution of words across topics, LDA assigns probabilities to each word in the vocabulary, indicating the likelihood of the word belonging to a particular topic.
